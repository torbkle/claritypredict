# ClarityPredict

**Explainable Machine Learning for Biomarker Prediction**

ClarityPredict is a prototype for clinically relevant machine learning, designed to predict biomarker levels based on laboratory data while providing transparent, interpretable explanations. The project combines predictive modeling with explainable AI (XAI) to support decision-making in healthcare and diagnostics.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Predict biomarker levels (e.g. CRP, Cystatin C) from simulated lab data  
- Provide interpretable explanations using SHAP  
- Deliver a user-friendly interface via Streamlit  
- Demonstrate responsible AI for clinical support  
- Serve as a portfolio project for health tech roles
